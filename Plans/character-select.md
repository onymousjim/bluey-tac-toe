# Character Selection Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview
Transform the fixed two-character Bluey Tac-Toe game into a dynamic character selection system where players can choose from any characters available in the Players directory.

## Phase 1: Character Detection and Data Structure
- **Scan Players directory** dynamically to detect all available character images
- **Create character metadata system** to store character names, image paths, and display info
- **Update game state management** to use selected characters instead of hardcoded 'bluey'/'bingo'

## Phase 2: Character Selection UI
- **Create character selection screen** that appears before the game board
- **Design character selection cards** showing character images and names
- **Implement two-step selection process**:
  1. Player 1 selects their character
  2. Player 2 selects their character (from remaining options)
- **Add "Start Game" button** after both selections are complete

## Phase 3: Dynamic Game Integration
- **Modify HTML structure** to dynamically populate player avatars and names
- **Update CSS system** to handle any character combination instead of fixed classes
- **Revise game logic** to work with selected character IDs
- **Update score tracking** to use selected character names

## Phase 4: UI/UX Enhancements
- **Create smooth transitions** between character selection and game screens
- **Add character selection validation** (prevent same character selection)
- **Implement "Back" functionality** to change character selections
- **Design responsive layout** for mobile, tablet, and desktop

## Phase 5: State Management
- **Persist character selections** in localStorage
- **Add character re-selection option** in game controls
- **Update scoring system** to track wins per character combination
- **Implement proper game reset** that returns to character selection

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Structure Changes:
- **index.html**: Add character selection screen container
- **script.js**: Major refactor for dynamic character system
- **styles.css**: Add character selection styling + dynamic character classes
- **Players/**: Support for any PNG files as selectable characters

### Key Features:
- **Automatic character detection** from Players directory
- **Extensible system** - adding new character PNGs automatically makes them selectable
- **Responsive design** optimized for all screen sizes
- **Smooth animations** and modern UI consistent with current styling
- **Backward compatibility** with existing score tracking

### Mobile Optimization:
- **Touch-friendly selection interface**
- **Compact layout** for character selection on phones
- **Proper spacing** and sizing for different screen sizes
- **Intuitive navigation** between selection and game screens

### Character Selection Flow:
1. **App starts** with character selection screen
2. **Player 1 prompt** appears with all available characters
3. **Player 1 selects** their character
4. **Player 2 prompt** appears with remaining characters
5. **Player 2 selects** their character
6. **Start Game** button becomes available
7. **Game begins** with selected characters

### Dynamic Character System:
- **Character detection**: Scan Players/ directory for PNG files
- **Name extraction**: Use filename (without .png) as character name
- **Image loading**: Dynamically load character images
- **CSS generation**: Create character-specific styles on-the-fly
- **State persistence**: Save selections in localStorage

### Responsive Design Requirements:
- **Mobile (â‰¤480px)**: Single column character grid, larger touch targets
- **Tablet (481px-768px)**: Two column character grid, medium sizing
- **Desktop (>768px)**: Multi-column character grid, optimal spacing

This implementation will maintain all existing functionality while adding the flexibility to support any number of characters simply by adding PNG files to the Players directory.
