## Testing Workflow
- Every time you complete a task, to verify the application is working, rebuild the docker container, then use puppeteer to open the application from the container, take screenshots to verify the changes, then play a game to completion, and take a screenshot of the winner.  if you can't play a game to completion or see the requested changes, fix the application until you can.  leave the application running in the container so i can validate.
- Never push to github without me explicitly telling you to.

## Communication Shortcuts
- Whenever I say "ship it", that means push the changes to github.
