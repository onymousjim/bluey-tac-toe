## Testing Workflow
- Every time you complete a task, to verify the application is working, use puppeteer to open the index.html file, take screenshots to verify the changes, then play a game to completion, and take a screenshot of the winner.  if you can't play a game to completion or see the requested changes, fix the application until you cans
- Never push to github without me explicitly telling you to
